    <h2><ul>It´s well known that <em><strong>Cats</strong></em> are better than dogs, and that is questionless, if you don´t think they are the best at all aspects you are literally wrong, is not my perspective, it´s a fact and im not going to let anyone come and try to change my opinion, there is no opinion, just truth.</ul></h2>
    <p><ul>Why are they better than anything?</ul>
        <ol>
            <li>There is a <a href="https://cabidigitallibrary.org/journal/hai" target="_blank">research</a> from 2017 from <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q3FOUqcAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Lori Kogan</a>, who studied at Colorado State university, she´s got a lot of studies on the animal world according to their advantages on human life, but on the research im focusing she declares cat as a "catalyst for the expansion of dialog and collaboration". So there it is, <em><strong>Cats</strong></em> make you more intelligent and better on your work by yourself and as a partner.</li>
            <li>Well, in front of dogs <em><strong>Cats</strong></em> even splash less water, and that has been checked by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Princeton University, that <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2010/cat-lapping-1112" target="_blank">research</a> confirms that <em><strong>Cats</strong></em> drink far more efficiently than dogs, and dogs go to the water and splash all of it while drinking.</li>
            <li>Money? <em><strong>Cats</strong></em> are way more cheaper, according to Animal Humane Society, <a href="https://www.animalhumanesociety.org/adoption/adoption-fees" target="_blank">adoption</a> on <em><strong>Cats</strong></em> goes from $39 to $317, but for dogs it goes from $129 to $767. And I know you can and should adopt for free, but even on that case the cat´s maintenance will be cheaper.</li>
            <li>This <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376635716303424" target="_blank">study</a> by Lindsay(from Monmouth University),Kristyn, and Monique(from Oregon State University) is shown that <em><strong>Cats</strong></em> love humans than food, even when people say "They only love you because you feed them", but know we know 100% that is not true, so one point more to <em><strong>Cats</strong></em>.</a></li>
            <li>Dogs, it often appears, love everyone. <em><strong>Cats</strong></em>, on the other hand, are more standoffish when meeting someone new. So cat´s love is more meaningfull than dogs love.</li>
            <li>After a web research on <em><strong>Cats</strong></em> and dogs weight between <a href="https://pets.webmd.com/cats/guide/healthy-weight-for-your-cat#1" target="_blank">PetsWebMD</a> and <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/breed-weight-chart/" target="_blank">AmericanKennelClub</a>, I can confirm that <em><strong>Cats</strong></em> take up less space at home. </li>
            <li>Need another big reason why <em><strong>Cats</strong></em> are better than dogs? They live a lot longer. In fact, <a href="https://www.petmd.com/blogs/thedailyvet/jcoates/2011/aug/how_long_do_cats_live-11496" target="_blank">Pet WebMDz</a> says a domesticated cat, on average, will live anywhere from 10 to 15 years. Dogs, on the other hand? Depending on size, eight to 11.</li>
            <li>Dogs smeel way more than <em><strong>Cats</strong></em>, even more if they are wet, so <em><strong>Cats</strong></em> have a big advantage right here.</li>
            <li><em><strong>Cats</strong></em> sleep a lot, and animals asleep are really cute, but there is a <a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/why-cats-sleep-so-much/" target="_blank">research</a> of why they sleep so much.</li>
            <li><em><strong>Cats</strong></em> are expert hunters and they will eventually help you by killing any rodent at home, there´s even a study from 2013 of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256669203_Quantifying_free-roaming_domestic_cat_predation_using_animal-borne_video_cameras" target="_blank">Biogical Conservation</a>, you will have to download a pdf but it explains how his history makes them being a really good hunters even on modern day.</li>
            <li>Dogs make a greater impact on enviroment than <em><strong>Cats</strong></em>, there is even a research from <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427311-600-how-green-is-your-pet/" target="_blank">NewZealandResearchers</a> in 2009.</li>
            <li><em><strong>Cats</strong></em> dont need to be taken on a walk.<em><strong>Cats</strong></em> will just tend to a litter box on their own volition. A cat and its owner mostly stay out of each other's bathroom business, and that's truly one of the sweetest reasons why <em><strong>Cats</strong></em> are better than dogs.</li>
            <li><em><strong>Cats</strong></em> can even use the toilet, is not the usual, but you can <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2017/03/22/you-can-train-your-cat-to-use-the-toilet-just-dont-expect-it-to-flush/" target="_blank">train</a> them to be even a better pet.</li>
            <li><em><strong>Cats</strong></em> can clen themselves, they literally lick themselves for cleaning, another very practical reason why they are better than dogs.</li>
            <li>Last but not least, once upon a time, they were literal gods. As early as 3000 B.C.E. on egypt, like Bastet(War/Protection) an Sekhmetm(Heal/Hunt) but maybe you have heard about a Sphinx, felines were worshipped as deities.There's also Dawon, the Hindu sacred tigress; Barong Ket, the Balinese "king of spirits;" and the entire pantheon of jaguar gods of the pre-Columbian Mayan era. So, maybe your cat could be a descendent from a deity, believe it or not is a interesting thing about them, so treat them like you should, with love and respect. </li>
        </ol>

        <h2><ul>If you still think <em><strong>Cats</strong></em> are not the best option, one of two, or you are terribly wrong and you should change all your mind to let them take your life away, or you are a very good teacher called Noemi who has a different taste as mine and i shouldnt have said anything agressive, but if you are not her and you still think that i´m wrong you are probably the literal meaning of trash. :) </ul></h2>
